Creating a Homework Assignment that applies knowledge learn in class to create a employee profile generator.

Keeping organised throughout my course is what motivated me to do this assignment . Creating a application that can be used by yourself potentially in the future is really rewarding knowing youve created something that is helping you in the long run.

This project was bulit to help keep on track of employees profiles and generate them throughout companies . Having a employee generator can ease the stress knowing what needs to be saved and secured can easily be put into the data base.

With using a employee generator managers can keep organised and on top of their staff it solves the problem of forgetting peoples information. new emplyees are easily put into the system aswell leaving no hasstle.

I believe my project stands out due to my clear display,and easy access to everything needed to be viewed, everything is organised in one place and can be acceses quickly or edited in the system if needed.
